# Restaurant-Website-ReactJS

Using react library, I have created a restaurant website.
In this website I have incorporated the following:

- Used JSX to properly display html and javascript.
- Created meaningful react components and used props to pass along certain properties within each component.
- Adding an image to website
- Created a html list from a javascript object.

# Demo of the website
